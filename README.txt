==Drag and drop upload block==

WARNING: Do NOT install this block on a Moodle 2.3 site. All the functionality of this block is now built into Moodle 2.3 as standard and using this block as well will cause problems.

Once installed on a course, this block allows you to drag and drop files directly from your desktop onto a course and have them appear as resouces on that course.

This block works with Moodle 1.9 and Moodle 2.x. (Although it has been more extensively tested with Moodle 2).
This is the Moodle 2.x version.

It has been tested with Firefox 5, Chromium 14 and Chrome 12 (all running on Ubunutu 11.04). It has no chance of working in IE, so don't bother trying (it may start working with IE10 or later, depending on MS implementing some key features of HTML 5).
It has only been tested with the 'Topic' course format.

==Changes==

2012-07-02 - Prevent block from installing on Moodle 2.3 site
2012-01-29 - Fixed error when uploading files if site default resource display is 'popup'
2012-01-16 - Finish/Danish translations from Paul Nijbakker
2012-01-12 - Now saves 'userid' in file database entry, so uploaded files appear in 'recent files' in file picker (thanks to Steve Miley)

==Installation==

1. Unzip the files to a suitable location on your local machine
2. Create a new folder on the server <moodleroot>/blocks/dndupload
3. Upload the files you unzipped to this new folder on your server
4. Login as administrator and click on 'Notifications'
5. Add the block to a course in the usual way
6. Turn editing on (in the usual way) - the block does not show if editing is off
7. Select a few files from your desktop and drag them onto a course section

You can now also drag a website address from a web browser window, to create a link; or some text selected in another application, to create a 'page' resource.

==Known issues==

* Does not work in all browsers (IE, older FF/Chrome)
* No easy way to delete all the files, if you accidentally upload too many files (you have to delete them one-by-one)
* Moving resources that you have just uploaded around has slight sorting issues with other files you have just uploaded (if it is a problem, refresh the page)
* Chrome seems to work fine with links/text from a range of sources. Firefox (version 7.0.1, tested on Ubuntu), seems fine with text from another Firefox Window, but struggles with that from other applications.

Special thanks to The University of St Andrews, for sharing some code to put some of the final polish on the operation of the block.
